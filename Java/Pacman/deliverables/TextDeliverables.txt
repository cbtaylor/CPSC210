Task M1
A few keywords I'm not sure about: static final this
I looked in the Oracle Java documentation and I also browsed on Wikipedia.

Task M2
In Board.java I looked in the Outline and saw tickBoard() and when I looked at the function it
appears to update the monsters and the pacman.

Task M3
Diagram included in deliverables

Task M4
tickBoard() first updates each monster in the trackerMonsters list by calling the makeMove()
method on each of the monsters. It uses a for-each loop to iterate over the list.
Once it has done that it updates each monster in the randomMonsters list by calling
the moveMove() method on each of the monsters. It uses a for-each loop to iterate over the list.
Finally it updates the pacman object by calling the makeMove() method.

Task M5
Part 1. By moving the closing brace '}' the pacman.makeMove() command is now part of the
        body of the for-each loop. When I run the program it's not actually that different.
        The user is still able to control the direction of the pacman and it moves in a similar
        fashion as before the change.
Part 2. New objects are constructed in the following lines:
		pacman = new Pacman(this);
		randomMonsters = new LinkedList<RandomMonster>();
		In the first line the object is a new object of the Pacman class.
		In the second line the object is a new object of the LinkedList class.
Part 3. The method being called in the last line is Pacman.setLocation().
        The parameters being passed to the moveTo method are sprite, new_x and new_y.
        sprite is of type Pacman, and new_x and new_y are ints
Part 4. x = 0 and y = 0 on the 1st iteration
        x = 1 and y = 0 on the 2nd iteration
        x = 2 and y = 1 on the 16th iteration
        x and y represent the cell location, i.e. the row and column
Part 5. There are two instances of the RandomMonster class and one instance of the
        TrackerMonster class.
Part 6. The || operator is the logical OR operator.
        So, the last line (return pacmanCaught || !existsFood;) returns either true
        or false depending on the values of pacmanCaught and existsFood.

Task M6
I found it a bit tricky distinguishing between step-in and step-over, but once I played
around with the debugger it became clear.
Placing the breakpoint inside the loop for part 5 of the previous task resulted in having to
step over quite a number of lines of code. It was better to put the breakpoint later to find
out what had actually happened by the time the loop was done.

Task M7
Part 1. I learned about the syntax of the two different types of for loops.
        I learned that method overloading is possible (e.g. multiple moveTo methods)
        I learned about the symbols used for logical connectives, && and ||
Part 2. I learned how to use the debugger in Eclipse. I can see this will be extremely
        helpful to figure out what's wrong with a specific piece of code.
        I learned how to look at the Call Hierarchy for specific methods, which is useful
        for knowing what methods call a specific method and what methods are called by
        that method.
        I learned how to jump to different method declarations, which will be very useful
        for figuring out what is going on in the program.
Part 3. I'm not sure how the updating takes place with respect to a clock tick.
Part 4. 3 - I feel confident using Eclipse
        4 - I feel confident exploring Java code
        2 - I feel confident writing Java code
        3 - I feel confident that I understand the code in the Pacman project
        3 - I feel confident that I understand the code in the Board class
        4 - I feel confident that I understand the intra-method control flow diagrams
