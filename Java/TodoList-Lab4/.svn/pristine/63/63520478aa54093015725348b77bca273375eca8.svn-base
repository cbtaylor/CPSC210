Task M3

Reflect on your experience introducing new types to provide a 3-5 sentence answer to the
following questions:

1) Do you think that the changes you made to the TodoList-Lab4 project improved the code
  Why or why not?  (Note: If you are unsure, consider whether the code became more or less
  readable, maintainable, or manageable).
  
  I think by creating an abstract class with two subclasses the code is more manageable,
  and the functionality of the two subclasses is better handled separately.

2)  Additionally,  please answer the final question using the following scale:

1 - strongly disagree
2 - disagree
3 - neutral
4 - agree
5 - strongly agree
