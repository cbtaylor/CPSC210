Task M1
-------
With assertions enabled it's not possible to put the bus back into a valid state because the
execution of the program has been halted.

Task M2
-------
Objects of type AutoBus can be used anywhere an object of type Bus can be used.
An object of type AutoBus is said to be assignable to a variable of type Bus.
This is called subtype polymorphism.  (ref. Learning Java, 4th ed.) However, it's possible
that the methods of AutoBus have requirements that are weaker than the requirements
for a comparable method of Bus. This would violate the Liskov principle.

Task M7
-------
The bus has been stopped, the door opened, the ramp lowered and an attempt is made to close
the door. The code should throw a RampException. The test will fail if either a MotionException
or a DoorException is thrown.

Task M8
-------
If a method of the subtype threw more exceptions than the overridden method in the supertype it
would violate the substitution principle. 

Task M9
--------

a) 4
